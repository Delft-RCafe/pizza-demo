  abstract = {Scrotal temperatures in men have been reported to be either similar on both sides or higher on the left than the right scrotum. We aimed to clarify this discrepancy from new data.Retrospective analyses of scrotal temperatures in men aged 20--52 years measured every 2 min with probes connected to a data collector in three experiments. In Experiment I, eight men have been submitted to four successive body positions for 15 min each, first naked then clothed. Experiment II involved 11 postal employees working in a standing position for 90 min continuously. Experiment III involved 11 bus drivers and a 90 min period of continuous driving. Outcome parameters were left and right scrotal temperatures.In Experiment I, mean values and kinetics of scrotal temperature differed significantly in the naked and clothed state. In all three experiments, left scrotal temperature in the clothed state was higher than right scrotal temperature in terms of mean values and temperature kinetics.Lack of thermal symmetry was seen in the right and left scrotum, whether naked or clothed, and this applied regardless of position or activity when clothed. This thermal difference between right and left scrotum could contribute to the asymmetry in the male external genital organs.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the potential role of pizza on cancer risk, using data from an integrated network of case-control studies conducted in Italy between 1991 and 2000. Cancer sites were: oral cavity and pharynx (598 cases), esophagus (304 cases), larynx (460 cases), colon (1,225 cases) and rectum (728 cases). Controls were 4,999 patients admitted for acute, non-neoplastic conditions to the same hospital network as cases. Odds ratios for regular pizza consumers were 0.66 (95\% confidence interval, CI = 0.47--0.93) for oral and pharyngeal cancer, 0.41 (95\% CI = 0.25--0.69) for oesophageal, 0.82 (95\% CI = 0.56--1.19) for laryngeal, 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.61--0.89) for colon and 0.93 (95\% CI = 0.75--1.17) for rectal cancer. Pizza appears therefore to be a favorable indicator of risk for digestive tract neoplasms in this population. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Pizza has been favourably related to the risk of prostate cancer in North America. Scanty information, however, is available on sex hormone-related cancer sites. We therefore studied the role of pizza consumption on the risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers using data from three hospital-based case--control studies conducted in Italy between 1991 and 2002. These included 2569 women with breast cancer, 1031 with ovarian cancer, 1294 men with prostate cancer, and a total of 4864 controls. Compared with non-pizza eaters, the multivariate odds ratios for eaters were 0.97 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.86--1.10) for breast, 1.06 (95\% CI 0.89--1.26) for ovarian and 1.04 (95\% CI 0.88--1.23) for prostate cancer. Corresponding estimates for regular eaters (i.e. {$\geq$}1 portion per week) were 0.92 (95\% CI 0.78--1.08), 1.00 (95\% CI 0.80--1.25) and 1.12 (95\% CI 0.88--1.43), respectively. Our results do not show a relevant role of pizza on the risk of sex hormone-related cancers. The difference with selected studies from North America suggests that dietary and lifestyle correlates of pizza eating vary between different populations and social groups.},
